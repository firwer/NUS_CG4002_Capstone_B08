This is the logic for the gun vest which will be the pseudo player 2
The current logic for this is as follows:
Game Logic Overview

- IR Signal Processing: The Arduino receives IR signals and decodes them to determine if a player has been shot or if a special action has occurred.
- Player Health Management: The playerâ€™s health is decreased by specific amounts based on the type of action:
    -  A standard shot decreases health by 10.
    - If the player is under a rain debuff, the damage from a shot increases to 15.
    - Additional attacking actions can cause an extra health decrease of 5, or 10 if under the rain debuff.
- Rain Bomb Effect: If a player is hit by a rain bomb, their health decreases by 20.
- Death and Respawn: When a player's health reaches zero, a death tune plays, and the player must respawn. Respawning resets the player's health to 100.
